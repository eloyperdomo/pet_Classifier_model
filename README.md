# Pet Classifier

## Overview
I built a classifier to identify three different animals (cats, rabbits and dogs). This could be useful for someone who sees and animal and do not know its name. They could take a picture of it and the name will be displayed. It could also be useful to develop a similar model to identify some specific animal breeds.

## Model
With this model I was able to achieve 98,2% accuracy. To built it I used a technique called Transfer Learning, which use a model already trained and adapt it to some specific task. This allowed me to achieve almost perfect accuracy after minimal training.

##Data
To obtain the data I used Being Image Search API, gathering 424 images.
